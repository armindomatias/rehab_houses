The bed and bedding appear clean but the metal frame could be modernized. Electrical condition is moderate; TV and visible cables from the mounted TV are exposed and need organizing or concealing for safety and aesthetics. There are no visible plumbing features in the room. Flooring consists of wood parquet that appears worn in some spots but generally intact. Ceiling and walls have minor discoloration and could benefit from a fresh coat of paint to brighten and modernize the space. There is one window visible with moderate condition; window frame and glass should be checked for drafts or damage. Overall, remodeling should focus on decluttering, updating electrical elements and furniture, repainting, and possibly improving window insulation."

Wall tiles are partially covered but visible parts seem stained or discolored, so retiling or repainting is suggested. There is one small window that is dirty or fogged, potentially sealed improperly, impacting ventilation and natural light; replacement or professional cleaning is recommended. Overall, the bathroom needs a modernization overhaul focused on fixtures, flooring, wall and ceiling repainting, and improved ventilation."

The single window provides natural light and should be inspected for sealing and operability. Overall, a modest remodel focusing on cabinetry, appliances, and paint would significantly improve this kitchen's functionality and look."
