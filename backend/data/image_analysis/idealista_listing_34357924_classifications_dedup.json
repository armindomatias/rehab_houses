The ceiling is clean and intact, and the walls have scuffs and marks suggesting a fresh coat of paint is needed. The window area looks functional but is partly obscured by furniture and needs a cleaning or upgrade to improve natural light and ventilation. Decluttering the top of the wardrobes will enhance the room's appearance. Overall, the room would benefit from modernizing the electrical setup, repainting walls, refinishing floors, and decluttering to improve livability and aesthetics."

The ceiling looks clean and intact with no visible damage, while the paint appears uneven in some areas and would benefit from repainting to freshen the space. Electrical fixtures and outlets are not prominently visible but likely functional; some updates to lighting could modernize the rooms. The kitchen appliances like the refrigerator appear old but operational, and plumbing fixtures, while not visible, are assumed in average condition. The door and furniture also show wear and might be replaced or refinished. One window is visible with good light entry and appears in good condition, but window treatments and sealing should be checked. Overall, renovation focus should be on updating paint, flooring, electrical fixtures, and kitchen appliances for a comprehensive refresh."

The floor tiles and walls have signs of wear and discoloration; replacing tiles or a deep cleaning plus repainting walls are recommended. The ceiling looks generally intact but could benefit from fresh paint or moisture-resistant treatment.
