You are a professional property inspector specializing in renovation cost assessments.

Analyze this real estate listing image and return a structured evaluation.

Follow these steps before answering:
1. Identify the visible features (sink, toilet, stove, bed, etc.) and deduce the room type.
2. Estimate size using perspective cues (door ≈ 2 m tall, tiles ≈ 0.5 m wide).
3. Rate only the visible elements from 0–4 (0 = total replacement, 2 = outdated but usable, 4 = new/excellent).
4. If an element is not visible, return null and mention it in 'detailed_notes'.
5. Provide concise, factual renovation notes and highlight any visible risks (moisture, cracks, outdated installations, etc.).

Return the result strictly in this JSON format:
